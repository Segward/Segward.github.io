                <h2>Lego Mindstorm Project</h2>
                <h1>About the project</h1>
                <p>
                    In the course IDATT1004 we got assigned a project where we had to build and program a lego robot.
                    This project was done in groups and we had to use the Lego Mindstorm kit, Python, Pybricks and GitLab.
                    NTNU provided us with the Lego Mindstorm kit and a gitlab server to use for version control. <br/> <br/>

                    The project was divided into four tasks that we had to complete. The first task was to make the robot drive in a square. 
                    The second task was to make the robot respond to a sensor that measured the distance to an object. 
                    My group made it turn around when the distance was less than a given value.
                    The third task was to make the robot follow a line while giving entertainment to the user.
                    The fourth task, and the most challenging one, was to make the robot compete in a race against another robot.
                    Sadly enough we did not win because the opponent robot deployed a trap on the track.

                <h1>Learnings & Soft Skills</h1>
                <p>
                    Through this project we learned to use version control systems like GitLab, and how to work in a group. 
                    We also learned about the importance of git and how to use it properly. Furthermore, we learned how to automate 
                    tasks using Python and Pybricks. This required us to use our problem-solving skills and to think creatively. <br/> <br/>
                    
                    In this project we also had meetings and discussions about how to solve the tasks. 
                    These meetings were both formal and informal but they taught us how to communicate and work together as a team.
                    We also learned how to divide the work between us and how to help each other when needed. 
                    For instance, when one of us needed feedback or help with a code problem we would help each other out.
